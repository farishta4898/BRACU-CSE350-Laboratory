<h3>CSE 350: Digital Electronics and Pulse Techniques (3 Credits)</h3>
Diode logic gates, transistor switches, transistor gates, MOS gates, Logic families: TTL, ECL, IIL, and CMOS logic with operation details. Propagation delay, product, and noise immunity. Open collector and High impedance gates. Electronic circuits for flip flops, counters and register, memory systems. PLA's (A/D, D/A converters with applications, S/H circuits) LED, LCD, and optically coupled oscillators. Non-linear applications of OPAMPs. Analog switches. Linear wave shaping: diode waveshaping techniques, clipping, and clamping circuits, comparator circuits, switching circuits. Pulse transformers, pulse transmission. Pulse generation: monostable, bistable, and stable multivibrators, Timing circuits. Simple voltage sweeps, linear circuit sweeps. Schmitrigger, blocking oscillators and time base circuit.
